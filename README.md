# The Ultimate Snake Machine

This repository attempts two tasks:
1. Build a simple snake game that can be played in the terminal.
Simultaneously the game should accept machine input.
2. Build some kind of reinforcement learning algorithm, best would be in tf2

## Status:
- A simple snake game is working; a gui can be used via curses
- The human user can interact via i,j,k,l
- A DQN class is copied from another repo; this is set up for gym
- See [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-build-a-deep-q-network-dqn-to-play-cartpole-with-tensorflow-2-and-gym-8e105744b998)
- See [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) for further reference
- There are further install instructions to get video export running
